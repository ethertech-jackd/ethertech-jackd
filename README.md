- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethertech-jackd
- 👀 I’m interested in ... things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything
- 📫 How to reach me ... get in touch with me and speak to me in person is the best, that way you know it's me and we can have a real private conversation.  Or, get in touch with my internet friend, Professor Potatoes.  He has some very strange ideas, but I help him with technology advice.
